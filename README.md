# Dataverse-Web-Report
This web report shows Dataverse usage statistics generated by the Dataverse Report python application found at [https://github.com/scholarsportal/Dataverse_Report](https://github.com/scholarsportal/Dataverse_Report)

Using the exported CSV files, information such as number of downloads, categories used and file size can be visualized.

Angular CLI was used to build the application and it has been exported to Git Hub Pages using angular-cli-ghpages

A working example of this report can be seen [here](https://scholarsportal.github.io/Dataverse-Web-Report/)

To use, simply place the generated CSV files in the "assets" folder and deploy to a webserver.
